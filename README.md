Let's say you are on the master branch and want to create a new branch to develop your web page. Here's what you'll do: Run git checkout -b <my branch name>. This command will automatically create a new branch and then 'check you out' on it, meaning git will move you to that branch, off of the master branch.


git branch


git remote add origin https://github.com/cubeton/mynewrepository.git
